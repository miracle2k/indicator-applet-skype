This fork simply integrates the changes from the improved deb package 
available here, for archiving purposes.

I'm not familiar (yet) with Debian packaging, so there is no functioning build
script, and the files might not be in the correct place.

./bin
   belongs into /usr/bin/
./share
   belongs into /usr/share
All other files
   belong into /usr/share/skype-wrapper


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a simple skype[0] plugin for Ubuntu's indicator-applet[1].

Installation:
Just start the script on your computer. Skype will automatically ask you if you
want to allow it's connection. As soon as the script is started the indicator
applot will have a 'Skype' entry that shows unread messages.

When you click the skype-entry SKype's main window will be shown. If you click
on one of the unread messages a message window for this conversation is opened.

TODO:
 * make this work better
 * update callback timeout
 * remove items that have been marked as read within Skype
 * et&
